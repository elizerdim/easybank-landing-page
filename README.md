## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- I didn't use BEM naming for this project and realized how it makes CSS much more manageable and understandable. I will be using BEM naming convention for future projects.

- &lt;small&gt; tag has a display of inline by default.

- overflow-x: hidden caused an automatic vertical scrollbar, and setting overflow-y: visible didn't work. I found the answer on this [stackoverflow entry](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6433475). "If you are using visible for either overflow-x or overflow-y and something other than visible for the other, the visible value is interpreted as auto."

### Continued development

I feel fairly confident in writing responsive code at this point and will focus more on JavaScript projects next.
